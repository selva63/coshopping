* The @apply directive is a Tailwind CSS feature, not standard CSS.
* Your code editor's linter might show an underline warning because it doesn't
* natively understand this syntax.
*
* This is a visual warning in your editor, and it does NOT prevent the code
* from working correctly in the browser, as the Tailwind CDN processes it.
*
* To remove this warning in your editor, consider installing a Tailwind CSS
* IntelliSense extension (e.g., for VS Code).
